	  Some cards do not support CMD23 to set the block count for multiple
	  block read/write operations. Enabling this option will issue a STOP
	  TRANSMISSION command at the end of each multiple block operation.

	help
	  This needs to be enabled if the LiteSDCard Module is not connected
	  to a coherent DMA bus, meaning that the cache needs to be managed
	  before and after DMA operations.
